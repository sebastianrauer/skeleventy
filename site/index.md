I take a product, feature or experience from ideation to production. This includes vision setting, designing solutions, prototyping, bringing along cross-functional teams, overseeing implementation, and collaborating with other designers, researchers, product managers, analysts, and engineers.

### About
Since 10+ years I shape how humans interact with their environment through digital products on desktop and mobile devices. Right now I do that @ [Next Big Thing AG](https://www.nextbigthing.ag/).

This website shows some projects I am currently working on and also is platform for some thoughts I have, regarding the role of technology in our all life.
